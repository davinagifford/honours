This directory contains scripts and data for calculating the EAC
copepod composition index. The directories are as follows:

R:      R scripts
bin:    Executable files (shell scripts)
data:   Source data (static as far as scripts here are concerned)
shape:  Shape files (static as far as scripts here are concerned)
var:    Intermediate files (generated by the R scripts)
output: Output files (e.g. graphs, maps, log files)

The R scripts are the only ones that need to be run. The order in
which they need to be run can be seen in the shell script
(bin/do_all). (You don't need to actually run the shell script: you
can run the R scripts any way you want.)

In addition to the CCI scripts, there are scripts that do a similar
thing with SST for comparison (read_sst_data.R, calc_eac_sst.R,
plot_sst_sites.R, plot_eac_sst.R).

I generally run each R script in a new R session to avoid problems
with things like clashes between different libraries or variables
created in one script accidentally being read by code in a later
script. The scripts save results for re-use in RDS files.

SST data for the CCI and SST analyses are from the RAMSSA dataset,
which is a GHRSST level 4 product produced by the BOM. For the CCI
analysis, the SST value for each CPR sample is the daily value. For
the SST analysis, the SST value for each query site is the monthly
average of the daily values. (In the RAMSSA dataset, daily values are
not strictly daily because the data are generated by an interpolation
method that incorporates data from previous days.)
